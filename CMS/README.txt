This application is a simple content management system that simulates the management of employees in a given workplace. The purpose of creating this application is to further explore the power of the Python ORM, Peewee.

If you wish to pull my code and test it out, make sure you have the following installed on your machine for best experience and results:
-> python3
-> peewee (make sure this is installed with pip3)
-> sqlite3 (we are storing information in a basic sqlite database for demonstration purposes).
